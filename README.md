Some projects of Unity3D
--------------------------------------
Here are my games projects on Unity3D
* **Tic-tac-toe**

Simple example of famous game for Android and iOS. It was a training project to gain first experience in programming games.

* **Sudoku**

My second experience in Unity3D. And in that project I implemented the interesting algorithm for generating tasks for the game. It is very convenient for the gameplay if code generates new Sudoku's cell for new game.
